# CanyonBomber
FPGA implementation of Canyon Bomber arcade game released by Atari in 1977


Initial release:
-- There is still some cleanup of the code that can be done and a minor bug where occasionally there is a small glitch in the motion object as a ship hits the edge of the screen. I am not abslutely certain at this time that this is specific to the FPGA version and not a bug in the original hardware or code.
